## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
        

## BEHAVIOUR DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
         During the development stages of this website, I as the developer had an idea of what the website would do upon completion of its development. This allowed me to break down its development into smaller sub-program which were then finally merged to create this site.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
         The technologies used in the development were: Hypertext Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets and Javascript.
